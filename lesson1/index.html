              representation of complex numbers

              This is another way to look at vectors, which is what we'll be
              using primarily in this course. If you wanted to geometrically
              represent this vector, you could think of it as (x, y, z)
              coordinates in

              Multiplication works similar to addition. \(c\) is what's known
              as a scalar, which is just a number or a quantity. You cannot
              multiply two vectors together like this

              This product is known as the scalar product. We're multiplying a
              vector by a scalar.

              As vectors are 1-D arrays, matrices are 2-D arrays. It's an
              array of arrays!

              If you wanted, you could scale up to 3-D arrays and higher
              dimensions, but we're not going to worry about that

              We first specify the row, then column

              This is a square matrix, as it has the same number of rows as 
              columns. It also just looks like a square

              The matrix here is not a square matrix

              Notice that the matrix is just an array of arrays. It's a vector
              of vectors. To access the 0th array (vector), we specify that
              first. Then we select the 1st element in it, to get 5.

              There are some other operaions such as conjugate, where each
              element of the resultant matrix is the conjugate of the original.

              This is a tensor product with vectors, but we can do the same

              do a quick review if we run into them in the future. The idea,
