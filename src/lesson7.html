            <aside class="notes">
              I give you a black box with a function in it. (draw on iPad)
              <br><br>
              You cannot see inside, but you can put bits through it and see the output.
              <br><br>
              How many queries on a classical computer does it take to determine which of the 4 functions it is?
              (answer: 2)
              <br><br>
              How about on a quantum computer?
              (answer: also 2 -- there are 4 possible states, so we need at minimum 2 bits of information)
              <br><br>
              How many queries does it take on a classical computer to find if it's variable/constant?
              (answer: 2 -- go through the queries)
              <br><br>
              How about on a quantum computer?
              (answer: 1 -- this is our first example of quantum outperforming classical)

              Hadamards on both qubits, then apply the "black box function" (pick one
              for the sake of implementation). Hadamard the top (input) qubit after
              the black box and then measure. If it's constant we get $|1\rangle$,
              otherwise we get $|0\rangle$ if it's variable.
